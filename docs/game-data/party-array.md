# The party member ARRAY in memory — instant full party at load (the real table)

The packet path only fills members the game *sends*; loading mid-party shows nothing
until packets arrive. The fix is to read the game's own **party member array** at load.
On **retail** this is the documented **Ashita `partymember_t`** (stride **`0x7C`**, **18
slots**: 0..5 = your party, 6..11 / 12..17 = alliance parties 2 / 3). Verified field-by-
field in-game (`model/party_state.cpp` `load_from_memory`).

**Anchor:** `g = *(LuaCore+0x1C8400)`; `pp = *(g+0x248)` (points **4 bytes into**
member[0]); `member[0] = pp - 4`; `member[i] = member[0] + i*0x7C`. Self-validate:
`member[0].ServerId` must equal the player id (else don't trust it).

| member offset | field | notes |
|---|---|---|
| `+0x0A` | name (char[18], ASCII NUL-term) | |
| `+0x1C` | u32 server id | the anchor-validation key |
| `+0x28` | u32 HP | |
| `+0x2C` | u32 MP | |
| `+0x30` | u32 TP | |
| `+0x34` | byte HP % | |
| `+0x35` | byte MP % | |
| `+0x36` | u16 zone id | member's zone (≠ yours ⇒ out of zone; offzone members are kept here) |
| `+0x3C` | u32 **flag mask** | quartermaster = **bit `0x10`** (verified: the bit moved to the member given QM) |
| `+0x71` | byte **main job id** | 1 WAR … 5 RDM … 22 RUN (verified: Kaories RDM=5, Tetsouo BLM=4) |
| `+0x72` | byte main job level | `0x63` = 99 |
| `+0x73` | byte **sub job id** | (verified: Tetsouo SCH=20, Kaories WHM=3) |

Jobs **are** in this struct (`+0x71`/`+0x73`, reversed 2026-06-28 from a live alliance dump
— an earlier note wrongly read `0`). Reading them here gives correct job badges for **every**
member of all three boxes instantly, with no dependence on packet timing. `load_from_memory`
runs every frame, so the roster + vitals + jobs stay live. Trust members (no job byte) fall
back to a name → job DB.

**Leadership is NOT a member flag — it's server-id matching against `allianceinfo_t`.**
`allianceinfo = *(pp)` (= `*(g+0x248)` dereferenced; this is the `//aio chain` "party"):

| allianceinfo offset | field |
|---|---|
| `+0x00` | u32 alliance leader server id (0 = no alliance) |
| `+0x04` | u32 **party-1 leader** server id (your party) |
| `+0x08` / `+0x0C` | u32 alliance party 2 / 3 leader ids |
| `+0x10`/`+0x11`/`+0x12` | byte party 1/2/3 visible |
| `+0x13`/`+0x14`/`+0x15` | byte party 1/2/3 member count |

A member is *party leader* iff its id == `+0x04`, *alliance leader* iff == `+0x00`.
Read live each frame (`read_party_leaders`) → the `*`/`^` markers follow the real role
automatically when leadership changes. Quartermaster is the only role that lives in the
member flag mask (`+0x3C` bit `0x10`), not here.
